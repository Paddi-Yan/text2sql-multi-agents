# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies

- **LangGraph**: Multi-agent workflow orchestration and state management
- **Function Calling**: LLM function calling capabilities for structured interactions
- **Milvus**: Vector database for semantic similarity search and embeddings storage
- **Redis**: High-performance caching and session management
- **Python**: Primary development language (inferred from tech stack)

## Architecture Patterns

- **Multi-Agent System**: Collaborative agents for different processing stages
  - Intent Understanding Agent
  - SQL Generation Agent  
  - Validation Agent
  - Optimization Agent
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Semantic matching using embeddings
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis-based caching with LRU eviction
- **Fault Tolerance**: Exponential backoff retry with circuit breaker patterns

## Database Support

- Multi-database compatibility (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Automatic schema discovery and metadata management
- Dynamic SQL generation based on database-specific syntax

## Performance Requirements

- Cache hit response time: < 100ms
- Automatic retry: Maximum 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Vector search optimization for large-scale similarity matching

## Security Standards

- SQL injection prevention and validation
- Permission-based access control
- Sensitive data masking in logs and history
- Audit logging for security monitoring

## Common Commands

*Note: Specific build/test commands will be added once the actual implementation begins*

```bash
# Development setup (placeholder)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests (placeholder)
pytest tests/

# Start services (placeholder)
docker-compose up -d
```
