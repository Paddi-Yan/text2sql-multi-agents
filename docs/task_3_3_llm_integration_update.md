# Task 3.3 LLM Integration Update: Decomposer Agent

## Overview

Successfully updated the Decomposer Agent to use real LLM API calls for query decomposition and SQL generation, replacing the previous template-based approach with intelligent language model processing.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. LLM Service Implementation
- **New File**: `services/llm_service.py`
- **Purpose**: Centralized LLM API handling with OpenAI-compatible interface
- **Features**:
  - Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Qwen, etc.)
  - Configurable model parameters (temperature, max_tokens)
  - Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - JSON and SQL response parsing utilities

### 2. Enhanced Query Decomposition
- **Before**: Rule-based decomposition with hardcoded patterns
- **After**: LLM-powered intelligent decomposition with contextual understanding
- **Improvements**:
  - Better understanding of complex query semantics
  - Context-aware sub-question generation
  - Reasoning explanations for decomposition decisions
  - Adaptive complexity handling

### 3. Intelligent SQL Generation
- **Before**: Template-based SQL with limited patterns
- **After**: LLM-generated SQL with full language understanding
- **Improvements**:
  - Natural language to SQL translation
  - Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning for complex queries
  - RAG context integration for better accuracy
  - Schema-aware query construction

## Technical Implementation

### LLM Service Architecture

```python
class LLMService:
    """Service for interacting with Language Models."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_name, api_key, base_url):
        # Initialize OpenAI-compatible client
        
    def generate_completion(self, prompt, temperature, max_tokens):
        # Generate text completion
        
    def decompose_query(self, query, schema_info, evidence, complexity_info):
        # Decompose complex queries into sub-questions
        
    def generate_sql(self, query, sub_questions, schema_info, fk_info, context, use_cot):
        # Generate SQL with optional Chain of Thought
        
    def extract_json_from_response(self, response_content):
        # Parse JSON from LLM response
        
    def extract_sql_from_response(self, response_content):
        # Clean and extract SQL from response
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Query Decomposition Integration
```python
# In QueryDecomposer.decompose_query()
try:
    llm_response = llm_service.decompose_query(query, schema_info, evidence, complexity)
    if llm_response.success:
        json_data = llm_service.extract_json_from_response(llm_response.content)
        if json_data and "sub_questions" in json_data:
            return json_data["sub_questions"][:self.config.max_sub_questions]
    # Fallback to rule-based decomposition
except Exception as e:
    # Error handling with fallback
```

#### 2. SQL Generation Integration
```python
# In SQLGenerator._generate_simple_sql()
try:
    llm_response = llm_service.generate_sql(
        query=question, sub_questions=[question], 
        schema_info=schema_info, fk_info=fk_info, 
        context=context, use_cot=False
    )
    if llm_response.success:
        return llm_service.extract_sql_from_response(llm_response.content)
    # Fallback to template-based generation
except Exception as e:
    # Error handling with fallback
```

### Configuration Integration

#### Environment Variables (.env)
```properties
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-8284b4da3a2e41c7817d447183f1da62
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=qwen-plus
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
```

#### LLM Configuration (config/settings.py)
```python
@dataclass
class LLMConfig:
    model_name: str = "gpt-4"
    api_key: Optional[str] = None
    max_tokens: int = 2000
    temperature: float = 0.1
    timeout: int = 30
```

## Performance Improvements

### Query Decomposition Quality
- **Before**: Simple pattern matching with limited accuracy
- **After**: Contextual understanding with reasoning
- **Example**:
  - Input: "Show average order amount for each customer category, sorted by total amount"
  - LLM Output: 5 logical sub-questions with reasoning explanation
  - Template Output: 1-2 generic sub-questions

### SQL Generation Quality
- **Before**: Basic templates with placeholder columns
- **After**: Schema-aware, contextually appropriate SQL
- **Example**:
  - Input: "Find top 5 customers by total order value in last year"
  - LLM Output: Complex CTE-based query with proper date filtering and ranking
  - Template Output: Simple SELECT with LIMIT

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to template-based approach on LLM failure
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error tracking and debugging information
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in timeout and error recovery mechanisms

## Testing Updates

### New Test Files
1. **`tests/unit/test_llm_service.py`** (20 tests)

### Example Outputs

#### Complex Query Processing
**Input**: "What is the monthly growth rate of premium customer orders compared to the previous year?"

**LLM Decomposition**:
1. What is the total number of premium customers in the current year?
2. What is the total number of premium customers in the previous year?
3. What is the monthly count of orders placed by premium customers in the current year?
4. What is the monthly count of orders placed by premium customers in the previous year?
5. What is the percentage growth rate of premium customer orders for each month?

**Generated SQL**: Complex CTE-based query with window functions, date calculations, and growth rate computation (200+ characters)
